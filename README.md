This project implements the backend code for a restaurant reviews and ratings app.
The python script app.py handles HTTPS requests that update a database (MongoDB) with information about each restaurant, including the name, address, menu items, reviews, and a vote system for the reviews.
The script authentication.py ensures user password protection using SHA256 encryption.
The script external_api.py uses the Zomato API to retrieve a list of restaurants and info near a certain address.

This project uses python, MongoDB database (https://www.mongodb.com/), Flask backend web application framework (https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/), and the Zomato API (https://developers.zomato.com/)
